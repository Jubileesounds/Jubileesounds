    <h2>Jubilee Sounds</h2>
</header>

<p>On the morning of October 17, 2014, I woke up with a clear and unmistakable message: "It is time for you to record your music." I knew instantly that this was the voice of God. My response, however, was simple: "What music?" I had no music to record, or so I thought.</p>

<p>Then, I heard the Lord say: "You will record 7 instrumentals, each 7 minutes long, to prepare My people for their Jubilee." The call was clear: I had been commissioned by God to create these seven pieces of music. The urgency and significance of the task overwhelmed me, and it felt as though failure wasn't an option. I sensed that this music was already written in heaven, and my role was simply to receive it and bring it to life.</p>

<p>At that time, I knew little about the concept of Jubilee beyond what I had read in the book of Leviticus. Despite my limited understanding, I felt a profound sense of divine purpose in the request. It seemed as though this assignment was connected to something far greater than I could fully grasp at that moment. The urgency of the message only deepened my sense of calling.</p>

<p>From this encounter, two significant things came to pass:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Creation of the Jubilee Sounds Soundtrack</strong>
        <p>I obeyed the call and created a CD featuring 7 instrumental tracks, each 7 minutes long. This project not only fulfilled God's command but also received recognition, being nominated for Instrumental of the Year at the Gospel Music Association (GMA) of Canada.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>A Revelation of the Modern-Day Jubilee</strong>
        <p>This divine encounter sparked a deeper revelation about the significance of Jubilee in today's world. I came to understand that this call wasn't just about creating music.
