    <h2>Collaborating with God in Restoring the Earth to Its Original Purpose</h2>
    <p><strong>Jubilee Sounds</strong> is a space dedicated to sharing prophetic insights and music that help us understand God’s plan for restoring the Earth to its original purpose. Through original music, articles, and reflections, my goal is to encourage spiritual growth, deepen faith, and inspire participation in God’s divine restoration.</p>

    <p>This website is still in its early stages, but it already offers valuable insights into <strong>God’s Jubilee timetable</strong>, the true meaning of love, and our role in His restoration plan.</p>

    <h2>How Jubilee Sounds Began</h2>
    <p>Jubilee Sounds began with a divine encounter that led to two significant revelations:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>The Creation of the Jubilee Sounds Soundtrack</strong>
            <p>In obedience to God’s call, I created a CD featuring <strong>seven instrumental tracks, each seven minutes long</strong>. This project not only fulfilled God's command but also received recognition, earning a <strong>nomination for Instrumental of the Year</strong> at the Gospel Music Association (GMA) of Canada.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A Revelation of the Modern-Day Jubilee</strong>
            <p>Through this encounter, God revealed a deeper understanding of <strong>Jubilee in today’s world</strong>. I came to see that this call wasn’t just about music—it was part of a broader prophetic message about God’s plan to restore the Earth to His original design.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
