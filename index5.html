    <h1>The Jubilee Sounds Story</h1>
    <p>On October 17, 2014, I woke up to hear these words: "It is time for you to record your music." I knew this voice was God's, though I initially questioned, "What music?" I had no music to record. But God made it clear: "You will record seven instrumentals, each seven minutes long, to prepare My people for their Jubilee." A sense of divine urgency filled me; I knew I couldn’t fail. It felt as though the music had already been written in heaven, and I simply had to receive it and record it.</p>
    
    <p>At that time, I knew little about the biblical Jubilee beyond its mention in Leviticus. While I understood that the Jubilee represented the return of land to its rightful owner, I didn’t fully grasp why God was speaking to me about it. However, I sensed that this request was urgent and of great significance.</p>
    
    <p>Without hesitation, I went to my small home studio and began to experiment with sounds. I was thrilled when I created two atmospheric sounds that blended perfectly. For a moment, I thought the task of composing the seven instrumentals would come easily. However, God told me to wait before I started writing any music. He asked me to wait for the release of a specific synthesizer software before beginning. At first, this seemed strange. I thought, "Why should I wait? I have no time to lose." But I obeyed, trusting that God was guiding me every step of the way.</p>

    <p>The synthesizer I was waiting for, Omnisphere 2, was released in April 2015. This was a significant moment, but I had little time to work, as God had clearly instructed that the album be completed by Rosh Hashanah 5776 (September 2015). I used this waiting period not only to prepare my heart for the project but also to learn more about the coming Jubilee and its meaning. It became clear that God was in control, and I needed to trust His timing.</p>
    
    <p>In March 2015, while volunteering at a Women on the Frontline Conference at Angelus Temple, I received further confirmation. During a pre-service prayer, a leader called out the date October 17. I immediately knew that this was the same date God had spoken to me about Jubilee Sounds, confirming that I was to move forward with the project.</p>
    
    <p>When Omnisphere 2 was finally released, I eagerly dove into the software, spending hours listening to thousands of sounds to choose the ones that would form the sonic palette for the project. Another important step was creating a unique sound that contains the entire Bible. This sound would be woven throughout the CD, representing God's Word and presence.</p>
    
    <p>As I prepared to begin recording, I remembered hearing a teaching about 432Hz tuning. Some claimed it is the natural tuning for the body, though I could not find scientific proof. Still, I trusted the credibility of those teaching it and decided to record the CD in 432Hz, believing this was what I was supposed to do.</p>
    
    <p>By the time I was ready to start recording in April 2015, I had one completed seven-minute instrumental and a two-minute acoustic guitar piece.</p>

    <h2>The Instrumentals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>In the Beginning</strong> (Holy Spirit Hovering Over the Earth) - It represents the Holy Spirit hovering over the earth, as described in Genesis, and also symbolizes the formation of a person in their mother's womb. The evolving melody reflects how our destinies unfold gradually as we grow and mature.</li>
        <li><strong>Our Father</strong> - This track is about God's loving kindness and His patience with us. It’s an invitation to rest in His presence, to receive His peace and acceptance. The music gives space for listeners to reflect on the depth of God's love for them.</li>
        <li><strong>The King Is Here</strong> - This piece had a special significance for me, as it was something I had written 15 years earlier during the final day of a 40-day water fast. I had asked God to give me a piece of music that would serve as a testimony to the fast. The two-minute guitar piece was completed in a single sitting, and I committed it to memory. I called it "The King Is Here" because it evoked a deep sense of reverence for Jesus' kingship.</li>
        <li><strong>The Word Became Flesh</strong> - This track encapsulates Jesus’ entire journey, from before the foundation of the world to His birth, death, resurrection, and ascension. Though it is the fourth track on the CD, it was the final instrumental I wrote for the album. With just 90 seconds left to complete the CD, I was at a loss for how to finish. I asked my pastors to pray for me, and shortly after, God revealed the drum part that completed the piece.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressing In</strong> - It represents a life filled with the Holy Spirit, a life that continually presses forward for more of God. It begins at conception and progresses through the various stages of physical and spiritual growth, highlighting the desire to draw closer to God.</li>
        <li><strong>The Goodness of God</strong> - This track was inspired by a vision I had one morning. I saw red lights flashing in a sequence, which I translated into a musical pattern. As I played the sequence, a powerful anointing came over me. My small studio felt vast, and I saw a thin cloud of white smoke before me. I was overwhelmed with joy and excitement, and I couldn’t help but exclaim to my wife, “God is so good, God is so good.”</li>
        <li><strong>One with God</strong> - This track invites the listener into deep intimacy (oneness) with the Lord. It represents the call to be united with God in purpose and destiny, and it reflects the restoration of the earth to its original purpose, echoing the theme of the Jubilee.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Jubilee Sounds Transmitted Around the Globe by Dunamis IPTV</h2>
    <p>Several weeks before I finished recording the CD, my wife was contacted by a friend she had met during an internship with Patricia King in Arizona. Laurel shared that she was about to launch an IPTV station called Dunamis and that God had instructed her to debut the station by playing Jubilee Sounds 24/7 for 40 consecutive days, starting on Rosh Hashanah 5776 (September 2015). This was a powerful confirmation and a huge encouragement for me to complete the album on time. Laurel also suggested the title "Jubilee Sounds," which felt like a perfect fit.</p>

    <p>After the release of Jubilee Sounds on Dunamis TV, the album was nominated for "Instrumental of the Year" at the 38th Gospel Music Awards in Canada. As the album gained traction, God continued to reveal insights about the significance of the 5776 Jubilee.</p>

    <p>I learned that the 5678 Jubilee year (which began in September 1917) marked the restoration of Israel, with the Balfour Declaration signed on November 2, 1917. The 5727 Jubilee year (which began in September 1966) signified the restoration of Jerusalem, culminating in the Six-Day War in June 1967.</p>

    <p>When I asked God what the 5776 Jubilee would be about, He responded: “I am restoring the earth to its original purpose.” I then saw the earth crowned with glory.</p>

    <p>Since this revelation, I started to see everything from the 5776 Jubilee—the restoration of the earth to its original purpose. Jubilee Sounds was created to help people meditate on and respond to this divine call.</p>

    <h2>The Jubilee Sounds CD</h2>
    <p>This music project is my response to God's invitation to record seven instrumentals, each seven minutes long, to prepare God’s people to enter their own Jubilee. The biblical Jubilee is about the restoration of land to its original owner and the freedom of the captives (Leviticus 25).</p>
